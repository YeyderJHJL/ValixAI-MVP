- **Automated Maturity Assessment:** Implement a logic-based classification system that categorizes users into one of three stages (Ideation, Validation, or Growth) based on their business experience and market knowledge, providing a personalized "Next Step" action plan.
- **Smart Incubator Matching:** A recommendation engine that connects users with specific partner programs (such as Scale or Jaku) by matching the user's maturity level with program requirements, prioritizing cost-effectiveness and upcoming application deadlines.
- **Brand Identity Refresh:** Update the entire platform's visual language to align with ValixAI’s official branding, utilizing the specific Turquoise (#1C9B9B) and Dark Blue (#0F2C4C) color palette and integrating the official logo across the user interface.
- **Enhanced Report Experience:** Add two high-impact sections to the final business report: a "Maturity Dashboard" featuring status badges and stage descriptions, and a "Recommended Program" card detailing program benefits, duration, and costs.
- **Direct Application Integration:** Include a prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) within the report that allows users to apply directly to their recommended incubator program via an external link, streamlining the transition from validation to execution.
